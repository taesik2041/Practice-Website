<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is built on top of the Internet, which pre-dated the Web by over two decades.

English scientist Tim Berners-Lee co-inventedthe World Wide Web in 1989 along with RobertCailliau. He wrote the first web browser in1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva,Switzerland.The browser was released outsideCERN to other research institutions starting inJanuary 1991, and then to the general public inAugust 1991. The Web began to enter everydayuse in 1993–1994, when websites for general usestarted to become available.The World Wide Webhas been central to the development of theInformation Age and is the primary toolbillions of people use to interact on theInternet.
