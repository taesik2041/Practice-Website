<h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve contentaccessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specificationof presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to shareformatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, whichreduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enablethe .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between thepages that share the file and its formatting.
